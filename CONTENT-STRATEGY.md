I build platforms that organizations can trust.

Over the past decade, I've led teams that deliver reliable, scalable systems—the kind that power businesses through their most critical moments.

My approach combines:
• Platform engineering that enables teams to ship faster
• SRE practices that balance innovation with operational excellence
• Observability platforms that drive better decisions
• Team development through mentorship and clarity

What I believe:
Technology leadership is a people game. The best architectures fail without the right culture.
Reliability is a competitive advantage. Speed without trust is just chaos.
Leadership is earned through clarity, not authority.

I'm building my path to CTO—not because of a title, but because I understand what it takes to align technology with business outcomes at scale.

Open to: Advisory | Speaking | Strategic Consulting | Mentoring

Let's talk if you're scaling platforms, building teams, or navigating technology leadership.

### About Nicolás Palavecino

I lead technology teams that build platforms organizations can trust.

**What I Do**

I specialize in platform engineering, site reliability, and operational excellence at scale. My work focuses on:

- Building developer platforms that accelerate delivery without sacrificing reliability
- Implementing SRE practices that balance innovation with operational discipline
- Creating observability systems that drive business decisions
- Developing engineering leaders through mentorship and strategic coaching

**How I Think**

Technology decisions are people decisions. The best systems in the world fail without the right culture and communication. I lead by creating clarity in ambiguity, enabling ownership, and aligning technical investments with business outcomes.

**Where I'm Going**

I'm building my path to CTO—not for the title, but because I understand what it takes to lead technology at scale. I know how platforms enable business, how reliability drives competitive advantage, and how culture shapes what's possible.

**Work With Me**

I'm available for strategic advisory, technical consulting, speaking engagements, and 1-on-1 mentoring. I work with CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and senior leaders navigating platform modernization, team scaling, and technical leadership transitions.
